      <p>You keep moving forward, the sharp crunch of loose stones beneath your boots echoing through the suffocating silence. The corridor twists and turns, leading you deeper into its oppressive darkness. Eventually, the passage widens, revealing a split ahead — three narrow, crooked corridors, each stretching into the unknown. From each, as if on cue, a voice begins to emerge. They are not shouts or whispers, but something in between, resonating within the deepest corners of your mind. It is impossible to tell if these voices are real or simply your own thoughts, distorted and cast back at you by this cursed place. But each one carries a strange pull, tempting you to follow.
        From the first path, a faint sound reaches your ears — an eerie, low whisper that gradually turns into strained, desperate breathing."You can’t escape. There’s nowhere to hide. It will find you. It always finds you."
        The whisper grows closer, its tone shifting — becoming more insistent, as if trying to catch your attention. "But... I know how to stop it. I have something that will protect you... something you can use." A soft rustling follows, as if something — or someone — slips through the shadows just out of view. The voice lingers in your mind, coaxing you deeper into the unknown, promising safety... if you follow.
        The second passage carries a low, urgent voice and the faint noise of hurried steps."This way — quickly! We have to move before it’s too late! It’s not safe to stay here!"
        The voice fades in and out, as though the speaker is moving further into the darkness. But there’s an unspoken challenge in their urgency — do you follow blindly, or question where they lead?
        From the third corridor comes a strangled shout, followed by the sound of stone crumbling. "Help! Please! It’s caving in — I’m trapped! Someone, please!" The desperation in their voice is unmistakable. The sound of falling rubble intensifies, and for a moment, you think you see dust billowing out from the mouth of the corridor. Time may be running out for whoever is calling.</p>
