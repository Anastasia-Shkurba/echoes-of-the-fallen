        <p>You are someone who values wisdom above all else, constantly seeking to understand the world and its
          intricacies.
          Deep down, you are protective, always wanting to safeguard those who cannot protect themselves. Your decisions
          are
          guided by a sense of duty, as you strive to maintain balance in a world that often seems to lack it. You stand
          firm, resolute in your beliefs, and are not afraid to face difficult situations head-on, knowing that your
          strength can shield others from harm.
          However, this protective nature can sometimes lead to sacrifices. You may find yourself making decisions for
          others, believing that you know what's best, even if they have not asked for your help. Your sense of
          responsibility can sometimes be overwhelming, and the weight of those decisions can lead you to carry more
          than
          your fair share of the burden. You may feel torn between protecting those around you and the knowledge that
          some
          things, perhaps, are beyond your control.
          Your connection to the past is strong, and despite the resistance of the entity that now lingers within you,
          it
          has fulfilled its promise — though begrudgingly. The power granted to you is a gift from the necromancer’s
          craft,
          the ability to call upon the wisdom of those who have passed. The spirits of the past now offer their counsel,
          appearing in your mind when you stand at a crossroads. This gift allows you to navigate through uncertainty,
          but
          it is not without its cost. The presence of the entity, though weakened, still clings to you, a constant
          reminder
          of the pact made. The weight of the past, along with the force that once sought to control you, will always be
          with you, as you struggle to honor the lives that came before, while shaping your own future.
          At your core, you are a protector and a guide, driven by a deep desire to preserve harmony and offer strength
          to
          those who need it.</p>
