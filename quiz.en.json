      "question": "As your senses slowly return, the cold, damp air of the forgotten place fills your lungs. The faintest echoes of something — a distant memory, perhaps? — stir in your mind, but they dissolve as quickly as they come. The shadows cling to the corners of the room, and the air smells faintly of dust and decay. You feel yourself lying on a cold, stone floor, the remnants of shattered glass and arcane tools scattered around you.\nYour hand brushes against something sharp. You grasp a jagged piece of broken mirror, its edges strangely warm to the touch. Holding it up, you see fragments of yourself reflected — distorted, fleeting, and unfamiliar. The shards shift and rearrange, as though the mirror itself is unsure of who you are.\nSo... Who are you?\nThe question lingers in the air, but the answer lies in your choice. You must decide now.",

      "question": "You slowly rise to your feet, your gaze lingering for a moment on the fractured surface of a nearby mirror. The reflection staring back at you feels unfamiliar, yet oddly fitting, as if something deep within you has stirred, shifted, and the air now feels heavier, as if your path is already beginning to unfold.\nYou step cautiously into the dim corridor that stretches before you, the flickering of unseen light revealing faint cracks in the walls. The passage leads you into what appears to be a grand hall, though much of it has crumbled over time. Massive, broken columns lean like weary giants, and shards of shattered mirrors litter the cold floor. Each broken reflection seems to whisper, as though trying to tell you something about who you are.\nThe silence is broken by a soft shuffle of feet, and suddenly, shadows in the corner of the room begin to move. A small group of figures emerges from the darkness, their eyes glowing faintly in the gloom. They seem neither fully hostile nor friendly, but they are clearly waiting for a sign — a gesture, a word, an action. You take a step forward, uncertain, but the tension in the air demands a decision.",

The shifting darkness seems to coil around you, not with malice, but with an almost piercing curiosity, examining your very essence.

The corridor twists and turns, leading you deeper into its oppressive darkness. Eventually, the passage widens, revealing a split ahead — three narrow, crooked corridors, each stretching into the unknown. From each, as if on cue, a voice begins to emerge. They are not shouts or whispers, but something in between, resonating within the deepest corners of your mind. It is impossible to tell if these voices are real or simply your own thoughts, distorted and cast back at you by this cursed place. But each one carries a strange pull, tempting you to follow.\nFrom the first path, a faint sound reaches your ears — an eerie, low whisper that gradually turns into strained, desperate breathing. \"You can’t escape. There’s nowhere to hide. It will find you. It always finds you.\"\nThe whisper grows closer, its tone shifting — becoming more insistent, as if trying to catch your attention. \"But... I know how to stop it. I have something that will protect you... something you can use.\" A soft rustling follows, as if something — or someone — slips through the shadows just out of view. The voice lingers in your mind, coaxing you deeper into the unknown, promising safety... if you follow.\nThe second passage carries a low, urgent voice and the faint noise of hurried steps. \"This way — quickly! We have to move before it’s too late! It’s not safe to stay here!\"\nThe voice fades in and out, as though the speaker is moving further into the darkness. But there’s an unspoken challenge in their urgency — do you follow blindly, or question where they lead?\nFrom the third corridor comes a strangled shout, followed by the sound of stone crumbling. \"Help! Please! It’s caving in — I’m trapped! Someone, please!\" The desperation in their voice is unmistakable. The sound of falling rubble intensifies, and for a moment, you think you see dust billowing out from the mouth of the corridor. Time may be running out for whoever is calling.",

A familiar, chilling presence brushes against your thoughts. The Entity’s voice fills your mind:\n \"Three paths, one choice. Each step shapes what you will become. Keep going, little one... You are beginning to see.\"\n Time here felt distorted, stretching and contracting without logic or mercy. How long you had been walking, you couldn’t say. The black corridors seemed unending, their suffocating void consuming every step. But then, as though growing tired of its game, the corridor spat you out before a massive door.\n It loomed before you: a monolithic slab of stone, adorned with intricate carvings that seemed to writhe when touched by shadow. Dry, darkened streaks of blood etched the grooves, as if a thousand hands had tried and failed to force their way through. There was no handle, no lock, no visible mechanism to grant passage.\n A thought slithered into your mind — your own, or perhaps placed there by something unseen: \"To pass, you must leave a part of yourself here. Blood for blood. Life for life.\" Your heart thudded in your chest. How would you approach this challenge?",

The way forward was open, but you couldn’t shake the feeling that the door had taken something from you, whether or not you had noticed or allowed.\nThe suffocating corridors give way to an unexpected stillness. Before you stretches a vast courtyard, enclosed by crumbling stone walls. A lifeless garden sprawls out beneath a gray, unmoving sky, the clouds thick and oppressive, yet refusing to weep.\nCracked statues stand scattered throughout the space, their weathered features contorted in expressions you can’t quite place — anguish? Reverence? Defiance? Dead trees twist their gnarled branches skyward, clawing for a sun that no longer shines. A brittle wind passes through, carrying neither sound nor scent, only the weight of silence.\nThe air here is still, as though the garden has been locked in this moment for eternity, untouched and forgotten.

It’s a feeling, almost imperceptible, like the flutter of a distant memory. Fragments flash across your mind, brief and elusive, but they slip through your grasp before you can make sense of them.\nAs you move further, you come upon a fountain — silent, still, its water untouched by the passing of time. Despite the decay that surrounds it, the water remains strangely clear, reflecting the gray sky above and the crumbling statues around. You peer into the basin, looking at your own reflection, and something shifts.\nAt first, it’s a subtle distortion, like a wave passing across the surface, but as you focus, the changes become more distinct.

      "text": "You are a conqueror at heart, driven by an unrelenting ambition to rise above others. Power is what you seek, and nothing will stand in your way. Your mind is sharp, and your ability to manipulate people and situations makes you a formidable force. You are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve your goals, even if it means crossing moral lines. To you, the ends always justify the means.\nYour cunning nature allows you to inspire those around you, leading them with charisma and strength, especially when your personal goals align with theirs. You know how to use others, how to make them feel as if their contributions are essential to your greater cause, all while ensuring your own power continues to grow. Your ambition has the potential to bring great success, but it also makes you a dangerous individual — one who is willing to sacrifice anything, and anyone, to achieve greatness.\nThe entity trapped within you, though resistant at first, has granted you the dark power of the necromancer. With this ability, you can take the strength, the vitality, or the energy of others, using it to fuel your own ascent. It is a power that feeds your relentless drive, but with it comes the danger of losing yourself, becoming nothing more than a predator, consumed by your own thirst for control.\nAt your core, you are a force of nature, a driven and ambitious leader who will stop at nothing to claim your rightful place at the top. Your power to take what others have is both your greatest strength and your most dangerous flaw. You are a conqueror, not just of people, but of your own destiny — one who will stop at nothing to shape the world in your image, no matter the cost."

      "text": "You are a shadow, both in body and mind. Silent, elusive, and always hidden, you move through the world like a whisper in the dark. Your preference is to stay unseen, to avoid the chaos and the conflict that others crave. The quietude of the shadows is your sanctuary, a place where you can observe and learn without interference.\nYour ability to remain unnoticed gives you a unique advantage: you see what others cannot. You understand the subtle shifts in the air, the unnoticed flicker of an expression, the hesitation in a breath. In these silent moments, you find opportunities others would miss. This skill allows you to manipulate situations to your advantage, to strike from the darkness when no one expects it.\nBut while you thrive in solitude, your obsession with remaining in the shadows can isolate you from those who might be able to help. Trust is a foreign concept to you, and this mistrust often leads you down dangerous paths. Your manipulative tendencies, though often a means of survival, can also alienate those around you. While you are adept at avoiding danger, you may unintentionally create your own by pushing others away.\nThe entity that lingers within you — unwanted and still pressing — has fulfilled its promise, though its gift was reluctantly given. It has granted you the ability to fade into the background, to move unseen as if you were but a ghost, a shadow in a world too bright for you.\nAt your core, you are a creature of the shadows, driven by a desire for freedom from the control of the necromancer. You trust no one and prefer the safety of isolation, always calculating the next move. You are a master of manipulation, able to twist situations to suit your needs, and your ability to move unseen is both a strength and a curse. In the darkness, you are at home, but even shadows must one day face the light."
